            <h2>The Journey to Transform Recruitment</h2>
            <p>
              Everything Talent was founded with a vision to transform the way
              organizations approach hiring. Frustrated by traditional,
              cumbersome methods of recruiting and recognizing the potential for
              bias in evaluating candidates, our founder set out to create a
              solution that simplifies the hiring journey while leveraging the
              latest advancements in technology.
